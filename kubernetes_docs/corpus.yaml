  technical_analysis:
    name: "Kubernetes Architecture Analysis"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for platform engineers learning Kubernetes.
      Questions should test understanding of control plane components, node
      architecture, scheduling algorithms, networking model, storage classes,
      and security contexts. Focus on how Kubernetes orchestrates containers.

  resource_reference:
    name: "Kubernetes Resource Reference"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific Kubernetes
      resource details - API field names, annotation meanings, label selectors,
      resource limits, or controller behaviors. Questions should target
      specific manifest fields, status conditions, and API interactions.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read K8s docs.
      Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact API field
      names, feature gate names, annotation keys, or documented behaviors
      that require the actual docs rather than general Kubernetes knowledge.
