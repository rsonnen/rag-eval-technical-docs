  366 HTML documentation files covering the Python standard library and language
  reference. Includes library modules (asyncio, collections, itertools, functools,
  pathlib, logging, unittest, json, re, os, sys, typing, dataclasses, contextlib),
  built-in functions, exceptions, data types, language reference (expressions,
  statements, data model), and tutorials. Source from python/cpython Doc directory,
  converted from reStructuredText to HTML. PSF license. Extensive cross-references
  and code examples.

  technical_analysis:
    name: "Python Standard Library Analysis"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for developers learning Python's stdlib.
      Questions should test understanding of module design, class hierarchies,
      protocol implementations, context managers, iterators, and async patterns.
      Focus on how standard library components can be composed.

  api_reference:
    name: "Python API Reference Lookup"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific Python API
      details - function signatures, method parameters, class attributes,
      exception types, or module constants. Questions should target specific
      return values, raised exceptions, and default behaviors.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read Python docs.
      Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact function
      signatures, parameter defaults, version additions, or documented
      behaviors that require the actual docs rather than general Python knowledge.
