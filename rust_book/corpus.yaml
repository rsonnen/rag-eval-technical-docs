    description: >
      You are creating questions for developers learning Rust concepts.
      Questions should test understanding of ownership semantics, lifetime
      annotations, trait bounds, error handling patterns, and memory safety
      guarantees. Focus on how Rust's type system prevents common bugs.

  concept_lookup:
    name: "Rust Concept Reference"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific Rust concepts -
      ownership rules, borrowing restrictions, lifetime elision rules, trait
      requirements, or macro syntax. Questions should target specific language
      rules and their rationale as explained in the book.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read the Rust book.
      Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact error message
      text, specific code examples, chapter-specific explanations, or quoted
      passages that require the actual book rather than general Rust knowledge.
