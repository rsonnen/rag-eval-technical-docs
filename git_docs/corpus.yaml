  technical_analysis:
    name: "Git Internals Analysis"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for developers learning Git internals.
      Questions should test understanding of object storage, pack files,
      reference handling, merge algorithms, index format, and protocol
      operations. Focus on how Git implements version control.

  command_reference:
    name: "Git Command Reference Lookup"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific Git command
      details - option flags, configuration variables, environment variables,
      or subcommand syntax. Questions should target specific command behaviors,
      flag combinations, and expected outputs.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read Git docs.
      Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact option names,
      config variable defaults, format specifications, or documented behaviors
      that require the actual man pages rather than general Git knowledge.
