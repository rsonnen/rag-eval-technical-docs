  technical_analysis:
    name: "Django Technical Analysis"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for developers learning Django internals.
      Questions should test understanding of the ORM, middleware pipeline,
      request/response cycle, template rendering, form validation, and
      authentication system. Focus on how Django components interact.

  api_reference:
    name: "Django API Reference Lookup"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific Django API
      details - QuerySet methods, model field options, form widget classes,
      management command arguments, or settings values. Questions should
      target specific method signatures, parameters, and return values.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read Django docs.
      Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact method names,
      setting defaults, deprecation versions, or quoted documentation text
      that requires the actual docs rather than general Django knowledge.
